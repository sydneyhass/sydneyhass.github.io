  "summary": "Hello, my name is Sydney Hass and I am a software developer working on a mission critical Java Spring application at the Bank of Canada. I am always looking for opportunities to learn new skills and work with different technology stacks. Working from home and my growing family have given me a new perspective on my life goals so I am looking to move into a fully remote position. üë©‚Äçüíª In my short career, I shaped the documentation for my team and enhanced our onboarding experience, receieved acknowledgements for my ability to clearly and concisely present information, and was noiminated for an Award of Excellence for my work as part of a team development project at the Bank of Canada. When I'm not working you can find me carrying my baby around, walking my dog, or tending to my garden. Please reach out if you want to discuss any interesting opportunities. ‚úåÔ∏è",
